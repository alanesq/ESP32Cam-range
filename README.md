Cycle passing vehicle distance recorder using an ESP32cam module with JSN-SR04T ultrasonic distance sensor using Arduino IDE.

The idea is to attach the sensor to the right side of a cycle and when any vehicles passes it will record to an sd card the distance the vehicle 
was from the cycle along with a image of the passing vehicle.  

This is curently a work in progress and not fully functional yet.
If it proves to work as I hope the idea is that this will be a very low cost way to collect some data on how close overtaking vehicles actually tend to get to cyclists.
Cost to build:
  ESP32Cam module 5ukp
  Distance sensor 6ukp
  SD Card under 10ukp
